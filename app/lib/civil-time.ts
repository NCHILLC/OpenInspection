/**
 * Civil (wall-clock) date + time → the UTC instant it names in a given zone.
 *
 * Forms collect what a person reads off a clock: "2026-07-15", "09:00". That pair
 * is not an instant until you say whose clock. The New Inspection wizard used to
 * combine them as `${date}T${time}:00Z`, which declares the typed time to be UTC —
 * so a workspace in America/New_York booked for 9am stored 05:00 local, wrong by
 * exactly the zone's offset and invisible to anyone testing from UTC.
 *
 * The conversion has no library behind it: guess that the civil time is UTC, ask
 * Intl what that instant reads as in the target zone, and correct by the difference.
 * One correction is exact wherever the offset is the same on both sides of it. On
 * the two days a year it is not, correcting a second time does not refine the
 * answer — it lands on the other side of the transition — so both candidates are
 * kept and chosen between explicitly. See civilToInstantISO.
