/**
 * The New Inspection wizard collects a civil date and a civil time — "2026-07-15",
 * "09:00" — and combined them as `${date}T${time}:00Z`, which declares the typed
 * time to be 09:00 UTC. An inspector types the hour they intend to arrive, in the
 * workspace's zone; nobody types UTC. So a workspace in America/New_York booked
 * for 9am stored 05:00 local and rendered that back, and the error was exactly the
 * zone's offset — invisible for a UTC tenant, four or eight hours for everyone else.
 *
 * These cases pin the conversion, including the two days a year it is genuinely
 * ambiguous. DST is where a naive offset calculation quietly fails, so the spring
 * gap and the autumn overlap are here by name.
